# CS276-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning

CS276/STATS231 is the course offered by Prof Song-chun Zhu at UCLA. 

Course Description

This course introduces fundamental concepts, theories, and algorithms for pattern recognition and machine learning, 
which are used in computer vision, speech recognition, data mining, statistics, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. 
Topics include: Bayesian decision theory, parametric and non-parametric learning, data clustering, component analysis, 
boosting techniques, support vector machine, and deep learning with neural networks.


Five projects

0. Exercise on Classification using Deep Learning and CNN

Experience the training and testing of problems in machine learning

1. Face modeling by AAM Model and FLD 

How many bits do you need to represent a face? Or telling apart male from female faces?

2. Face detection by AdaBoost and RealBoost 

How many features do you need to detect a face in a crowd?

3. Object detection by Fast-RCNN 

How to detect the class of an object and its location?

4. Face social attributes and Political Election Analysis by SVM 

How do we measure the social dimensions of faces in political elections and social network?
